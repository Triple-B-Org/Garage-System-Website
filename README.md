# Garage System Website

This is a GUI website created for a Garage System, that is to be used with a database in the backend.  
Four of us worked on this project together but each person had different roles in what they needed to code,  
which is laid out in the [Project Manual](https://github.com/Triple-B-Org/Garage-System-Website/blob/main/Project%20Manual.docx).
